        Hey there!
        <br><br>
        Bravo for trying to stay safe  from monsters by disabling
        <br>
        javascript, but you're going to need to turn it on to use this.

    For a fine, balanced and tuned experience, head over to the official <a href="https://dwrandomizer.com/">Dragon Warrior Randomizer</a> website by mcgrew. This unofficial version is merely a playground for me ðŸ™‚ Grab this fork's modified source files <a href="dwr-juef.7z">here</a>. Seed numbers and flags are incompatible with other versions. <b>See the 'New 1' and 'New 2' tabs for most of the new features.</b> Also, new credit music is by bran, auriplane, nicetas and myself.
